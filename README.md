Robert Dunn, Amelia Kawasaki, Cheolmin Hwang

### Why do we care about noise in our data?

Noise level of training data is key to the performace of a prediction model.

### Methodology

Used MNIST dataset and other image datasets.

Corrupted the datasets by swapping their labels or by altering the pixels of images.

Tested training on multiple models: Gaussian/Laplacian kernel functions, K-Nearest Neighbor classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Neural Network.

### Results
